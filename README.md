Mail Predictive System
The Mail Predictive System is designed to analyze email data and predict relevant outcomes using machine learning. Below is a step-by-step overview of the process:

1. Data Collection
Gather email datasets from available sources (e.g., public datasets, user-provided data).
Ensure the dataset includes features like subject, body, sender, timestamp, and labels (spam/ham or other classifications).
2. Data Preprocessing
Handle null values by filling or removing missing data.
Convert categorical features using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
Perform text preprocessing (tokenization, removing stop words, stemming, lemmatization).
3. Feature Engineering
Extract key features such as word embeddings, TF-IDF scores, or bag-of-words representation.
Utilize metadata features like email length, sender reputation, and frequency-based metrics.
4. Train-Test Split (TTS)
Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate performance.
5. Model Selection & Training
Choose an appropriate machine learning model (Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, or Neural Networks).
Train the model using the preprocessed data and optimize hyperparameters.
6. Model Evaluation
Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance.
Validate results using cross-validation techniques.
